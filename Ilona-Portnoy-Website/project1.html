	I take inspiration from many things around me. This is project was a merging of the mood I was in at the time of creating it and the colors that were next to me. The combination of blue and pink reminds me of cotton candy bubble gum and playfulness which is displayed in this gif. Though there is no sound, you can almost hear the bubble popping.

	The actual making of this gif was fairly simple but required a lot of attention to detail. With the help of photoshop, I was able to patiently create each frame, one by one. I started with the first frame which showed just the silhouette of a face, then added a wider circumference to each frame after that. Each bubble had to be carefully drawn so that when looped all together, the gif flowed seamlessly and there were no abrupt changes.
